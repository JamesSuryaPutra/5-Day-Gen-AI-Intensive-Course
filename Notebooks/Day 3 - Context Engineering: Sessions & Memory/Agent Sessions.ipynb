This is a truly exciting area because it moves beyond just *finding* existing molecules to *creating* entirely new ones tailored for specific purposes.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into that development:\n\n**The Core Idea: Beyond Screening to Creation**\n\nTraditionally, drug discovery involved screening vast libraries of pre-existing chemical compounds to see if any fit a particular biological target. This is like looking for a needle in a haystack. AI is changing this in two fundamental ways:\n\n1.  **Generative AI for De Novo Design:** This is the most groundbreaking aspect. Generative AI models, similar to those used to create art or text, can now be trained to design entirely novel molecules.\n    *   **How it works:** These models learn the underlying rules and patterns of chemistry – what makes a molecule stable, how atoms bond, what chemical features interact with biological targets. They can then generate completely new molecular structures that have never been synthesized before.\n    *   **Key Capabilities:**\n        *   **Targeted Design:** You can instruct the AI to design molecules that are predicted to bind strongly to a specific protein target involved in a disease.\n        *   **Property Optimization:** You can specify desired properties beyond just binding affinity, such as:\n            *   **Solubility:** How well the drug dissolves in water, crucial for absorption.\n            *   **Permeability:** How well it can pass through cell membranes to reach its target.\n            *   **Metabolic Stability:** How long the drug stays active in the body before being broken down.\n            *   **Reduced Toxicity:** Designing molecules that are less likely to cause harmful side effects.\n        *   **Exploring Chemical Space:** AI can explore vast regions of \"chemical space\" – all possible molecular structures – that are impractical for humans to explore manually or through traditional high-throughput screening.\n\n2.  **Accelerated Screening of Virtual Libraries:** While generative design creates new molecules, AI also significantly enhances the screening of existing or AI-generated virtual libraries.\n    *   **Predictive Models:** AI can build sophisticated predictive models that estimate how well a molecule will bind to a target, its likely absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) properties, and potential toxicity, all *before* the molecule is synthesized.\n    *   **Ranking and Prioritization:** This allows researchers to quickly rank and prioritize the most promising candidates from a virtual library, focusing expensive and time-consuming laboratory work on the ones with the highest probability of success.\n\n**Why is this a Big Deal?**\n\n*   **Speed:** Dramatically reduces the time it takes to identify and optimize potential drug candidates. What used to take years can potentially be done in months or even weeks.\n*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** By focusing resources on the most promising candidates and avoiding the synthesis and testing of many less effective molecules, AI can significantly reduce the cost of early-stage drug discovery.\n*   **Novelty:** Generative AI can design molecules with novel scaffolds and properties that might not be discovered through traditional methods, potentially leading to breakthrough therapies.\n*   **Personalization:** In the future, AI could design drugs optimized for specific patient subgroups or even individual patients based on their genetic makeup and disease profile.\n\n**Companies and Examples:**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** As mentioned, they've been a leader in using AI for generative drug design and have had AI-discovered drugs enter clinical trials.\n*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for structure-based drug discovery, screening millions of compounds against targets.\n*   **Exscientia:** Employs AI to accelerate drug design and discovery, aiming to find optimal drug candidates more efficiently.\n*   **BenevolentAI:** Uses AI to analyze vast amounts of scientific data to identify new drug targets and potential therapeutic compounds.\n\nThis development represents a shift from *finding* existing solutions to *engineering* new ones, fundamentally changing the paradigm of early-stage drug discovery.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The field of AI-driven molecule design and optimization is dynamic and involves a mix of established pharmaceutical giants, specialized AI drug discovery startups, and large tech companies investing in this space.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
